title: Bucardo targetdb
---

The **targetdb** is used as one possible destination for a [sync](/Bucardo/sync "wikilink"). It points to an entry in the [bucardo.db](/Bucardo/tables/bucardo.db "wikilink") table and referes to a single (slave) database. If more than one slave database is needed, you must use a [targetgroup](/Bucardo/targetgroup "wikilink") instead.
