Failover is possible using Bucardo, although that is not one of its primary goals. For [swap syncs](/swap_syncs "wikilink"), of course, there is very little that needs to be done - just point your application to the other database. For a [pushdelta sync](/pushdelta_sync "wikilink") on the other hand, making one of the slaves into a master involves the following steps:

-   Set the old master as 'inactive' in the [db table](/db_table "wikilink").
-   Alter the sync so that the new master is the sourcedb.
-   Run [validate_sync](/validate_sync "wikilink") so that triggers and other supporting items get created on the new master.
-   If you are in doubt that the slaves are up to date, set [onetimecopy](/onetimecopy "wikilink") to 2.
-   Restart Bucardo
