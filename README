This repository contains the source MarkDown documents for the Bucardo.org site,
including all Bucardo documentation.

This project is intended to be built via Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/)

The short version for getting this running locally:

    $ gem install bundler jekyll
    $ alias jekyll='bundler exec jekyll'
    $ jekyll serve

This will create a static version of this site in the `_site` directory and
start a server from localhost that you can browse and test any changes.

Submit a pull request with any documentation improvements, etc, and if approved
we will update the main bucardo.org site to match.
